## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

This project automates the provisioning of **KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine) virtual machines** using Terraform (Infrastructure as Code), supporting multi-OS deployments with flexible networking configurations.

### Key Features
- **Multi-VM Provisioning**  
  Deploy multiple virtual machines simultaneously with customized resources (CPU, RAM, disk).
- **Cross-OS Support**  
  Provision Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora, Rocky Linux, and other distributions in the same environment.
- **Dual Networking Modes**  
  - **NAT**: For isolated VMs with outbound internet access
  - **Bridge**: Direct LAN integration for production-like environments
- **Infrastructure as Code**  
  Version-controlled VM configurations with Terraform's declarative syntax.
- **Cloud-Init Integration**  
  Automate initial setup including user accounts, SSH keys, network and package installation.
